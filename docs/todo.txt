Tommorow:

Restarting services after a shutdown:
1. Services are on both slash and on r2d2.friendlyCyborg.com
2. To find service names: ls /etc/systemd/services

What I started:
On r2d2.friendlyCyborg.com:
sudo service dbService start  # Checked status and found permission error on /tmp/_8007,txt.. removed and restarted and it is ok

On slash:
sudo service config start
sudo service slash8008 start


Note: Always check status and logs of services: 
sudo service <name> status
sudo journalctl -u <name> -f #gives running status when you start/stop in another window
